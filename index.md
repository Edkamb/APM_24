Welcome to the website of the Sixth Workshop on Asynchronous Programming Models, which will be held 2nd -- 4th October in Turin, Italy, hosted by the University of Turin.
Information about prior iterations can be found [here](https://abs-models.org/publications/). 


## Description
The APM Workshop is a venue for the discussion of asynchronous programming patterns, languages and model, ranging from theoretical results, over applications and implementations to opinion and overview contributions. To create a welcoming atmosphere for the community, there are no proceedings -- instead we welcome presentations on published, on-going or envisioned work. We especially encourage the participation of junior researchers and presentations that can be the basis for discussions on the future of the field.

The APM workshop stands in the tradition of the [ABS](https://abs-models.org) workshop, whose [last iteration](http://edkamb.github.io/ABS_23) took place in Lyon, France, but is not specific to any language or paradigm. 

## Venue

The workshop will be held at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Turin, located at the center of the beautiful city of Turin: 

Palazzo Campana
Via Carlo Alberto, 10
