Welcome to the website of the Sixth Workshop on Asynchronous Programming Models, which will be held 2nd -- 4th October in Turin, Italy, hosted by the University of Turin.
Information about prior iterations can be found [here](https://abs-models.org/publications/). 

The APM Workshop is a venue for the discussion of asynchronous programming patterns, languages and model, ranging from theoretical results, over applications and implementations to opinion and overview contributions.
To create a welcoming atmosphere for the community, there are no procedeedings -- instead we welcome presentations on published, on-going or envisioned work.

The APM workshop stands in the tradition of the [ABS](https://abs-models.org) workshop, whose [last iteration](http://edkamb.github.io/ABS_23) took place in Lyon, France, but is not specific to any language or paradigm. 


## Venue
The workshop will be held in Turin, Italy. Once confirmed, more information will be added to this website. 
There will be a modest registration free to cover coffee breaks and lunches, and an option to register for a social dinner.
